How to set up:
  Download and Zip the manifest.json file and background.js file
  Go to <your_web_browser>://extensions (works best on chrome)
  Turn on developer settings and click on "Load Unpacked"
  Select the zip folder from your file browser
  And finally.. the most important step - follow me on github

feel free to add more websites to background.js, or link a database to it :)
